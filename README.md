Legendary AWS DevOps Projects ðŸš€

This repository showcases my hands-on AWS DevOps projects, where I focus on building secure, automated, and scalable CI/CD pipelines using AWS services.

These projects are part of a continuous learning journey where I explore AWS tools like CodeDeploy, CodeArtifact, CodeBuild, CloudFormation, S3, and IAM.

Deploy a Web App with AWS CodeDeploy

Automated application deployments with AWS CodeDeploy, CloudFormation, and custom deployment scripts.
Key highlights:

Automated EC2 + VPC setup using CloudFormation (IaC)

Deployment automation with CodeDeploy scripts (install, start, stop server)

Configured appspec.yml and buildspec.yml for CI/CD integration

Used deployment groups + IAM roles for secure, scalable rollouts

Secure Packages with AWS CodeArtifact

Secured software dependencies and artifact management with AWS CodeArtifact.
Key highlights:

Created a secure CodeArtifact domain and repository

Integrated with Maven Central as an upstream repository

Attached least-privilege IAM policies to EC2 for secure token access

Compiled app with Maven + settings.xml to pull dependencies from CodeArtifact
